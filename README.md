## 📖 About the Project <a name="about-project"></a>

Hello React is the front-end for a simple greetings application.

## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>

<ul>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>React-redux</li>
  <li>React-router</li>
</ul>

##  Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>
- **The power of Ruby on Rails and React working together as back-end and front-end, respectively.**
- **This is only a test app, and basically it just displays greeting messages on the home page (only one available).**

## 🔭 Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

- User registration and sessions, reservations maybe?

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get started with the app, follow the instructions below:

### 🛠 Setup <a name="setup"></a>

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Movgto/hello-react-front-end.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd hello-react-front-end
   ```
### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>
Before you can run this app, make sure you have the following prerequisites and configurations in place:

- **Rails back-end**: <a name="backend-instructions"></a> This app needs to be connected to an API managing the back-end in order to work properly. So, see the instructions [here](https://github.com/Movgto/hello-rails-back-end) for setting up the back-end application.

- **Node.js**: This is mandatory to run the front-end side of the application made with React since we needed for installing the dependencies for the project.

With these prerequisites and configurations in place, you'll be ready to set up and run the app.

### 📖 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Follow these steps to use the app:

In your terminal and the root of the project.

Run this for installing the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

And this to start the React application on the local server:

```bash
npm start
```

**Congratulations, now you have both applications running! (Assuming that you also followed these [instructions](#backend-instructions) to run the back-end)**

Now just open your browser and go to [this link](localhost:3000) and see them in action.
